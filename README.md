# Embedded databases

This repo showcases how to effectively use DuckDB, LanceDB and KÃ¹zu for OLAP querying via multiple data models. Python code and examples will be provided, along with an associated blog post.

## What are embedded databases?

An embedded database is a DBMS (database management system) that is tightly integrated with the application software. They are often referred to as serverless databases, because they do not require a client-server architecture (as is common in large-scale software systems). Another characteristic of embedded databases is that they typically offer a choice between in-memory storage, or serverless on-disk storage for larger-than-memory datasets.

It is this combination of features that allows embedded databases to be the go-to choice for OLAP (online analytical processing) workflows, i.e., when the consumer of the data wants to run analytical queries on the data.

The following embedded databases and their associated data structures are considered in the provided examples:

- [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) (table)
- [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) (vector)
- [KÃ¹zu](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu) (graph)


### DuckDB

DuckDB is a high-performance analytical database system that can be queried via a rich SQL dialect. Its core is written in C++, and is designed to be fast, reliable and easy to use. DuckDB is designed to support OLAP query workloads, which are typically characterized by complex, relatively long-running queries that process significant portions of the stored dataset, for example aggregations over entire tables or joins between several large tables. Changes to the data are expected to be rather large-scale as well, with several rows being appended, or large portions of tables being changed or added at the same time.

### LanceDB

LanceDB is an open-source database for vector-search built with persistent storage, which greatly simplifies retrieval, filtering and management of embeddings. LanceDB's core is written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and is built using [Lance](https://github.com/lancedb/lance), an open-source columnar format designed for performant ML workloads that's [100x faster than parquet](https://blog.eto.ai/benchmarking-random-access-in-lance-ed690757a826) for random access.

### KÃ¹zu

KÃ¹zu is an in-process property graph database management system (GDBMS) built for query speed and scalability. It is written in C++, optimized for handling complex join-heavy analytical workloads on very large graph databases, and is under active development.

## Setup

Install a Python virtual environment and then install the dependencies via `requirements.txt` as follows.

```sh
python -m venv .venv  # python -> python 3.10+
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip wheel  # Upgrade pip and install the wheel package first
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
